/// to disable" contract are the same.
///
/// The knob is not just stored, it is arithmetic input: the write path derives the
/// per-repo lease steal bound from it (`* 2 + 60`), and #174 routed it into
/// `build_filtered_pack` and `blob_paths`, which each build a deadline as
/// `Instant::now() + Duration::from_secs(this)`. That addition panics on overflow in
/// RELEASE as well as debug, so an unbounded `u64` here turns an operator typo into a
/// serve-path crash rather than a very long timeout. Bounding at parse time keeps every
/// derived duration in range at once, instead of hardening each site as it is found.
///
/// The ceiling is representability, NOT a policy view of a sane timeout, and that
/// distinction is what sets the number. The help text has always told operators to set
/// this very large to disable the bound, so values like `999999999` (~31 years) are
/// working production "off" settings; a tighter, tidier cap would fail those nodes at
/// boot on upgrade over a value that was never the defect. 100 years clears every such
/// setting while staying a factor of about 5.85 under the ~584-year ceiling of a
/// `u64`-nanosecond `Instant`, which is the tightest representation on any platform we
/// build for. Every value that worked before still parses; only the ones that would have
